## Getting and Cleaning Data

The script 'run_analysis.R' can be sourced into R
and will immediately perform the required actions:

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
